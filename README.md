# Game-Of-Life---Digital-Logic-Sim
Conway’s Game of Life implemented as pure digital logic on an 8×8 LED-style grid, built in Sebastian Lague’s **Digital Logic Sim**.   The board state is stored entirely in flip-flops / registers, and the next generation is computed using combinational logic inspired by a hardware framebuffer.
